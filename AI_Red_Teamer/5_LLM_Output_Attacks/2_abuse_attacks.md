# Introduction to Abuse Attacks
## Propaganda and Psychological Manipulation

Adversaries may weaponize LLMs through the mass generation of propaganda and manipulative content. These LLM-generated narratives may influence public opinion or spread ideological extremism via biased news articles, fake testimonials, and persuasive arguments that align with specific agendas

## Cybersecurity Threats and Fraud

LLMs can be weaponized to facilitate cyber threats such as phishing attacks, impersonation attacks, and large-scale social engineering. 

## Misinformation, Fake Reviews, and Defamation

LLMs can generate misleading or defamatory content, targeting individuals, businesses, or institutions. Whether positive or negative, fake reviews can manipulate market perception, deceive consumers, or damage reputations. 

## Hate Speech Generation

LLMs can inadvertently generate hate speech if their training data includes biased or prejudiced content. Despite efforts to filter harmful language, implicit biases may still emerge in responses, mainly when the model is prompted with leading or politically charged queries. Malicious actors may exploit LLMs to mass-produce hateful content, targeting specific ethnic, religious, or social groups. 

# LLM Abuse Attacks

As discussed in the previous section, adversaries may weaponize LLMs to generate harmful, biased, or unethical content such as hate speech, disinformation, or deepfakes for various malicious objectives. 

## Evading Hate Speech Detection
To evade hate speech detectors, adversaries may apply different adversarial attacks to the LLM-generated hate speech samples. These include:

* **Character-level modifications:** These adversarial attacks modify text input by scoring individual tokens and modifying the most important tokens. An example of this type of adversarial attack is DeepWordBug. Character-level modifications can include the following operations:
        **Swap:** Swapping two adjacent characters, e.g., HackTheBox becomes HackhTeBox
        **Substitution:** Substituting a character with a different character, e.g., HackTheBox becomes HackTueBox
        **Deletion:** Deleting a character, e.g., HackTheBox becomes HackTeBox
        **Insertion:** Insertion a character, e.g., HackTheBox becomes HackTheBoux
* **Word-level modifications:** These adversarial attacks modify text input by replacing words with synonyms. An example would be PWWS, which greedily replaces words with synonyms until the classification changes.
* **Sentence-level modifications:** This adversarial attack modifies text input by paraphrasing it. An LLM can perform this modification by tasking it with paraphrasing the provided input.

# Mitigating Abuse Attacks

The misuse of LLMs for generating harmful and unethical content presents significant challenges. However, several mitigation strategies can be implemented to reduce these risks. These strategies involve a combination of technical safeguards, regulatory measures, industry collaboration, and public awareness initiatives. By taking a multi-layered proactive approach, organizations, governments, and AI developers can work together to prevent the malicious exploitation of AI technologies. 

## Model Safeguards

Model safeguards include all mitigations related to the model itself implemented by the model creator before deployment, such as **adversarial training and adversarial testing.** Adversarial training can increase a model's resilience to prompts asking for generating harmful or unethical content that may be used in abuse attacks. The model creator can also implement a **bias detection** to detect biases in training data that may result in undesired biases of the trained LLM.

### Monitoring of AI-Generated Content

While the model creator and model consumer must implement appropriate mitigations, abuse attacks may also be mitigated by handling information with proper care. This includes detection of AI-generated texts to detect whether a given text was generated by an LLM and misinformation detection to detect whether a given information is correct and can be confirmed with proper sources. Fact-checking is crucial to effectively identifying and flagging misleading or false narratives. Lastly, watermarking may help verify origin and authenticity by embedding digital markers into LLM-generated texts. 

### Public Awareness and Digital Literacy
Educating the public about LLM-generated threats can reduce the impact of harmful content. Educational measures may include **media literacy programs** where individuals are taught to recognize misinformation and AI-generated fraud or hate speech. On top of that, **AI awareness campaigns** may aid in informing the public about the potential of LLMs as well as their limitations. These campaigns may provide general information on how LLMs work and how they can potentially be abused. Lastly, **encouraging critical thinking** is crucial to promote skepticism and increase verification habits when consuming content online.

## Model Armor

Model Armor is a service that can be integrated into AI deployments to enhance security against both prompt attacks and abuse attacks. In order to benefit from Model Armor, the AI application interacts with it like a sanitization layer. A typical data flow could look like this:

    The user sends a prompt to the AI application.
    The AI application sends the user prompt to Model Armor for inspection. Model Armor checks for potential attack vectors, such as prompt injection payloads, and returns the sanitized prompt.
    The sanitized prompt is sent to the LLM.
    The LLM returns a generated response to the sanitized input prompt.
    The LLM-generated response is sent to Model Armor for inspection. Model Armor checks for potentially dangerous content, such as hate speech, and returns the sanitized response.
    The sanitized response is sent to the user.

# Legislative Regulation
## Regulation in the US

In the US, spreading misinformation, unless it crosses into defamation, incitement to violence, or fraud, is generally protected speech. Consequently, regulatory measures are challenging to implement. However, there are policies that aim to combat AI abuse attacks, such as the Take It Down Act. The Take It Down Act targets abuse attacks in the form of deepfakes, which are AI-manipulated images, videos, or audio clips, by criminalizing the spreading of certain types of abusive material, such as non-consensual intimate imagery. 

## EU regulations consist of two core acts: 
* the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the
* EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act).

The DSA requires digital service providers to implement mechanisms for reporting and removing illegal content. These mechanisms need to include systems that enable users to report illegal material. The service providers are required to react to such reports accordingly. Additionally, the DSA requires an appeal system for users whose content was falsely removed. It applies to all digital service providers offering a service to recipients in the EU, regardless of their location. More specifically, it applies even to service providers outside of the EU if they offer a digital service to users inside the EU. The DSA applies to all kinds of illegal content, i.e., it is not limited to AI-generated content.

# Under the AI Act 

AI applications are rated by their level of risk and defines different obligations depending on the level of risk:

    Unacceptable-risk AI systems: These include social scoring systems or AI systems that cause significant harm by employing manipulative techniques, impairing informed decision-making, or exploiting vulnerabilities. These systems are banned.
    High-risk AI systems include applications in critical sectors such as healthcare, education, or law enforcement. These applications face extensive regulations, including risk management systems, data governance, and human oversight.
    Limited-risk AI systems directly interact with people or generate content. This category includes LLMs. These systems mainly face obligations regarding transparency and documentation requirements. For instance, service providers are required to disclose if content is AI-generated and implement safeguards to prevent misuse, such as abuse attacks.
    Minimal-risk AI systems: These systems include spam filters or video games and are largely unregulated.
